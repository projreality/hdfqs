Installation
============

There are two ways of using HDFQS. One is to install it as a Python module. The other is to include it directly in your code.

Installing as a Python module
-----------------------------

Copy (or git clone) hdfqs into the Python modules directory (for Python 2.7, this is /usr/lib/python2.7).

In python, import the module as::

  import hdfqs;

or::

  from hdfqs import HDFQS;

Including directly in code
--------------------------

Copy HDFQS.py into your source code directory. In your code, import the module as::

  import HDFQS;

or::

  from HDFQS import HDFQS;
